# algorithmic_toolbox_coursera

This repository contains my solutions of the programming assignments I had to complete in the Algorithmic Toolbox course offered by University of California San Diego & HSE University on coursera. 

(The solutions are done in java)


The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. It includes a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. It involves practicing solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).
